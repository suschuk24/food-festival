Food Festivals all have one thing in common. Location, location, location. An unfortunate coincidence to this is spotty cell phone reception. In todays age of web tech and customer relationship management, having the ability for users to access information, and make changes is paramount to customer retention. 

Introducing Food Festival. A modularized progressive web application that allows users to view daily schedules, testimonials, view ticket pricing information, and purchase tickets all without having the dependency of consistent internet connectivity.
